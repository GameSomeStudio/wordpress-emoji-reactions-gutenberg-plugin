# wordpress-emoji-reactions-gutenberg-plugin
This plugin allows you to easily add interactive emoji reactions to your posts or pages. Each emoji displays its own counter, and visitors can vote only once per post (IP or cookie-based restriction). Ideal for quick user feedback without the need for complex comment systems.
